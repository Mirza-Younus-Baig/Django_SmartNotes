### To setup the project, follow the below steps:

<br>`git clone https://github.com/Mirza-Younus-Baig/Django_SmartNotes.git`
2. Navigate to the Django_SmartNotes folder.
<br> `cd <Location>/Django_SmartNotes`
3. Create a python virtual environment 
<br> `python3.11 -m venv <venv_NAME>` # Use your required python version and enter your desired venv name
4. Activate the python virtual environment
<br> `source <venv_name>/bin/activate`
5. Install the python package requirements
<br> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the server
<br> `python manage.py runserver`
7. You can now copy/click the link to navigate to the django website
